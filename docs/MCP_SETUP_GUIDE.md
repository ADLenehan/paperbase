## üöÄ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Install MCP SDK (1 minute)

cd backend
pip install mcp

# Or if you have requirements.txt issues:
pip install 'mcp>=1.0.0'
```

### Step 2: Restart Backend (1 minute)

```bash
# If using Docker
docker-compose restart backend

# If running locally
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Check:** You should see in logs:
```
MCP Integration: Available
To use with Claude Desktop, configure: ...
```

### Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop (2 minutes)

**File:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paperbase": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "app.mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/paperbase/backend",
      "env": {
        "PYTHONPATH": "/absolute/path/to/paperbase/backend"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Replace** `/absolute/path/to/paperbase/backend` with your actual path!

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop (30 seconds)

1. Quit Claude Desktop completely
2. Reopen Claude Desktop
3. Look for "Paperbase" in the tools list

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Claude Desktop doesn't show Paperbase

**Check 1:** Is the path absolute?
```json
// ‚ùå Wrong
"cwd": "../backend"

// ‚úÖ Correct
"cwd": "/Users/yourname/paperbase/backend"
```

**Check 2:** Is Python in your PATH?
```bash
which python
# Should show python location
```

**Check 3:** Can you run MCP server manually?
```bash
cd backend
python -m app.mcp.server
# Should start without errors
```

### Frontend shows "Disconnected"

**Check 1:** Is backend running?
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/mcp/status
# Should return {"enabled": true, "status": "connected"}
```

**Check 2:** Is MCP SDK installed?
```bash
pip list | grep mcp
# Should show: mcp  1.x.x
```

**Fix:** Install MCP
```bash
pip install mcp
```

### Tools not appearing in Claude

**Check 1:** Restart Claude Desktop completely (quit, don't just close)

**Check 2:** Check Claude Desktop logs
```bash
# Mac
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log

# Linux
tail -f ~/.config/Claude/logs/mcp.log
```

**Check 3:** Verify config file syntax
```bash
# Must be valid JSON!
cat ~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json | python -m json.tool
```

## üìä Verify Everything Works

### Backend Check

```bash
# Test MCP status endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/api/mcp/status

  "resources_count": 2,
  "message": "MCP server is running and ready for Claude"
}
```

## üÜò Getting Help

### Check Logs

```bash
# Backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend

# Claude Desktop logs (Mac)
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp.log

# Frontend console
Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console tab
```

### Common Issues

1. **"MCP not found"** ‚Üí Install: `pip install mcp`
2. **"Disconnected"** ‚Üí Restart backend: `docker-compose restart backend`
3. **"No tools"** ‚Üí Check Claude Desktop config path is absolute
