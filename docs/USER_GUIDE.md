## Getting Started

### What is Paperbase?

Paperbase is a no-code document extraction platform that:
- **Learns from your documents** - Upload 3-5 samples, AI generates extraction schema
- **Processes documents automatically** - Bulk upload and extract structured data
- **Maintains high accuracy** - Human-in-the-loop verification for low-confidence items
- **Scales efficiently** - Costs ~$25-35 per 1000 documents

### First Time Setup

1. **Access the application**: Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your deployment URL)

2. **No login required** (MVP): The current version is single-user

3. **Ensure services are running**:
   - Backend: `http://localhost:8000/health` should return `{"status": "healthy"}`
   - Frontend should load without errors

2. Review verified examples - any patterns?
3. Update schema with better hints
4. Re-test on sample documents

**If processing errors are high**:
1. Check document quality (scans vs. native PDFs)
2. Review error messages in document details
3. Verify Reducto API status
4. Check system resources

**If verification queue is growing**:
1. Adjust confidence thresholds (lower = fewer verifications)
2. Schedule dedicated verification time
3. Improve schema to increase accuracy
4. Consider field importance (not all need 100% accuracy)

## Tips & Best Practices

### Schema Design

**DO**:
- ‚úÖ Start with 5-10 most important fields
- ‚úÖ Use specific extraction hints ("Invoice #:" not "Number:")
- ‚úÖ Test schema on varied samples before bulk processing
- ‚úÖ Set appropriate confidence thresholds per field importance

**DON'T**:
- ‚ùå Create 50+ fields for first schema (start simple)
- ‚ùå Use vague hints ("Date", "Amount")
- ‚ùå Set all thresholds to 0.9 (you'll verify everything)
- ‚ùå Extract data that's calculated (derive from other fields)

### Document Quality

**Best Results**:
- Native PDF documents (not scanned images)
- Clear, legible text
- Standard formatting
- Recent documents (better OCR for scans)

**Handling Scans**:
- Use high-resolution scans (300+ DPI)
- Ensure proper contrast
- Straighten/deskew images before uploading
- Consider pre-processing with OCR tools

### Processing Workflow

**Recommended Workflow**:

1. **Batch upload** similar documents together
2. **Process in groups** of 50-100 documents
3. **Spot-check** first 5-10 results
4. **Verify low-confidence** items in dedicated sessions
5. **Review analytics** weekly
6. **Refine schema** based on feedback
7. **Re-process** if major improvements made

### Cost Optimization

**Keep costs low**:
- Upload 3-5 samples (not 50) for onboarding
- Use schema editor to refine (free) before re-testing
- Batch process documents to minimize API overhead
- Set smart confidence thresholds (balance accuracy vs. verification time)
- Run weekly improvements, not daily

**Expected Costs**:
- Onboarding: <$5 for 5 samples
- Processing: $25-35 per 1000 documents
- Improvements: ~$2-5 per weekly run

## FAQ

### General

**Q: What document types are supported?**
A: Currently PDFs. Support for Word docs, images, and other formats coming soon.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
A: MVP is single-user, local deployment. Documents stored on your server, not shared. Production will add encryption and access controls.

**Q: Can I process documents in batches?**
A: Yes! Upload hundreds of documents at once. Processing is parallelized.

**Q: What languages are supported?**
A: English is best supported. Other Latin-alphabet languages work well. Non-Latin scripts (Arabic, Chinese) may have lower accuracy.

### Schema & Extraction

**Q: How do I handle multi-page extractions?**
A: Fields can span pages. Use hints that appear on the relevant page. System tracks source page for each extraction.

**Q: Can I extract tables?**
A: Yes, but as individual fields. Table extraction as structured data is on the roadmap.

**Q: What if my documents have different formats?**
A: Create separate schemas for different document types, or use broad hints that work across formats.

**Q: How do I extract optional fields?**
A: Mark field as `required: false` in schema. System will extract if found, skip if not.

### Verification

**Q: How many documents do I need to verify?**
A: Depends on confidence. Typically 5-15% need verification. After 50-100 verifications, accuracy improves significantly.

**Q: Can I skip verification?**
A: Yes, but accuracy may suffer. Verification creates training data for improvements.

**Q: Can multiple people verify?**
A: Not in MVP (single-user). Multi-user verification workflow is planned for v1.1.

### Performance

**Q: How fast is processing?**
A: 2-5 seconds per document typically. Large documents (50+ pages) may take 10-15 seconds.

**Q: Can I process 10,000 documents?**
A: Yes! MVP handles <10k docs well with SQLite. For larger volumes, migrate to PostgreSQL (see Deployment Guide).

**Q: What if processing fails?**
A: Errors are logged. You can retry failed documents. Common causes: corrupt PDF, API timeouts, oversized files.

### Analytics

**Q: How is confidence calculated?**
A: Reducto provides `logprobs_confidence` (0.0-1.0) for each extraction, based on OCR/parsing certainty.

**Q: What's a good confidence threshold?**
A: Depends on use case:
  - Critical data (financial, legal): 0.85+
  - Important data (names, dates): 0.75+
  - Nice-to-have (descriptions): 0.6+

**Q: Can I export analytics?**
A: Yes, via API. Dashboard export feature coming soon.
