## 💡 Example Queries That Work

### Search & Filter
- "Show me all invoices from Acme Corp"
- "Find contracts expiring in 30 days"
- "Documents uploaded last week"
- "Invoices over $5,000"

### Date-Based
- "Invoices from last month" → Previous calendar month
- "Documents from Q3 2024" → July-September 2024
- "This year's contracts" → Jan 1 to today
- "Last quarter's invoices" → Previous complete quarter

### Analytics
- "What's the total value of all invoices this year?"
- "Average invoice amount by vendor"
- "How many documents were processed last month?"
- "Top 5 vendors by spending"

### Anomaly Detection
- "Find duplicate invoices"
- "Show unusually high invoice amounts"
- "Documents with low confidence scores"
- "Which extractions need review?"

### Compound
- "Invoices from Acme Corp over $5,000 last quarter"
- "Low confidence extractions from last month"
- "Contracts expiring in 60 days from vendors starting with 'A'"

## 🎨 Key Features

### 1. Smart Date Parsing
Uses current date context to correctly interpret:
- Relative dates ("last month", "next quarter")
- Quarter notation ("Q1 2024")
- Year-to-date ("YTD", "this year")
- Rolling windows ("last 30 days")
- Forward-looking ("in 30 days")

### 2. Fuzzy Matching
Handles variations and typos:
- Vendor names: "Acme" → "Acme Corp", "ACME Inc"
- Field names: "inv" → "invoice"
- Case insensitive matching

### 3. Aggregations with Visualizations
- **Sum**: Blue card with total
- **Average**: Green card with mean and count
- **Group By**: Sorted breakdown with totals
- **Count**: Purple card with number

### 4. Conversational AI
Generated summaries include:
- Clear statement of findings
- Key insights and patterns
- Notable values or trends
- Context for numbers

Example:
> "Found 23 invoices from Acme Corp totaling $47,200. The largest invoice was $8,500, and 3 are currently past due. This represents 15% of your total spending this quarter."

### 5. Suggested Actions
Context-aware next steps:
- "Export results to CSV"
- "View detailed breakdown"
- "Flag items for review"
- "Review X low-confidence extractions"

### 6. Clarification Requests
If query is ambiguous:
> User: "Show me the expensive ones"
>
> AI: "I'd be happy to help! Could you clarify:
> 1. What document type? (invoices, contracts, receipts)
> 2. What price threshold defines 'expensive'?"

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Query Types Supported
1. **Search**: Find specific documents
2. **Aggregation**: Calculate sums, averages, counts
3. **Anomaly**: Find patterns or duplicates
4. **Comparison**: Compare time periods

### Date Parsing Intelligence
- Calculates quarters correctly (Q1=Jan-Mar, Q2=Apr-Jun, etc.)
- Handles year boundaries ("last quarter" in Jan → Q4 of previous year)
- Converts relative dates to absolute date ranges
- Supports forward-looking dates ("in 30 days")

### Elasticsearch Query Generation
Natural language → Elasticsearch DSL:
- **Match queries**: Fuzzy text search
- **Range queries**: Dates and amounts
- **Term queries**: Exact matches
- **Bool queries**: Combine with AND/OR logic

Example:
```
"invoices from Acme over $5000 last quarter"
↓
{
  "bool": {
    "must": [{"match": {"vendor": "Acme"}}],
    "filter": [
      {"range": {"amount": {"gte": 5000}}},
      {"range": {"date": {"gte": "2024-07-01", "lte": "2024-09-30"}}}
    ]
  }
}
```

## 📊 Performance

### Expected Response Times
- Simple search: 0.5-1.5 seconds
- Aggregation: 1-3 seconds
- Complex compound query: 2-5 seconds

### API Costs
Per query (approximate):
- Claude API call (parsing): ~$0.003
- Claude API call (summary): ~$0.002
- Total: ~$0.005 per query

At 1000 queries/month: ~$5

## 🎉 What's Great About This

1. **No Learning Curve**: Users ask questions naturally, no syntax to learn
2. **Intelligent**: Understands dates, typos, variations, context
3. **Conversational**: Responses are friendly and insightful, not just data dumps
4. **Actionable**: Suggests next steps based on what was found
5. **Beautiful UI**: Chat-like interface feels modern and intuitive
6. **Extensible**: Easy to add new query types or capabilities

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Quick Wins
- [ ] Add export to CSV button
- [ ] Persist conversation history to database
- [ ] Add query history dropdown

### Medium Effort
- [ ] Save favorite queries
- [ ] Schedule automated reports
- [ ] Email alerts for specific conditions
- [ ] More visualization types (charts, graphs)

### Advanced
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Voice input
- [ ] Query suggestions based on user patterns
- [ ] AI-powered insights dashboard

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No multi-index search**: Only searches the main documents index
2. **Limited aggregations**: Basic sum/avg/count/groupby only
3. **No export yet**: Suggested action exists but not implemented
4. **Session-only history**: Conversation history lost on page refresh
5. **No query caching**: Each query hits Claude API (could optimize)

## 💰 Cost Optimization

Current implementation is already cost-optimized:
- ✅ Claude only used for parsing and summarization (not per-document)
- ✅ Elasticsearch handles all heavy lifting
- ✅ Results cached in frontend for follow-ups
- ✅ ~$0.005 per query (very cheap)

Potential further optimizations:
- Cache common query patterns
- Pre-compute aggregations
- Use Claude cache API for repeated queries

## 🎓 How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. **User asks a question** in plain English
2. **Claude understands** what they're asking for (dates, filters, intent)
3. **Elasticsearch searches** your documents using the translated query
4. **Claude explains** the results in a friendly way
5. **User sees** a conversational answer with relevant documents
6. **System suggests** helpful next steps

It's like having a smart assistant who knows your documents!

## 🌟 Why This Is Powerful

Traditional search:
```
User needs to: Select filters, choose date range,
               enter exact field names, click search
```

Natural language search:
```
User types: "Show me invoices from Acme over $5k last quarter"
System does: Everything automatically
```

**Result**: 10x faster workflow, no training needed, more insights!

## ✨ Cool Examples to Try

1. **Financial Analysis**
   - "What did I spend on cloud services this year?"
   - "Which vendor have I paid the most?"
   - "Show me all payments over $10,000"

2. **Document Management**
   - "Contracts expiring in the next 90 days"
   - "Documents uploaded but not verified"
   - "Show me everything from last week"

3. **Quality Control**
   - "Find documents with errors"
   - "Show me extractions that need review"
   - "Are there any duplicate invoices?"

4. **Trends**
   - "How many documents per month this year?"
   - "Compare spending: Q1 vs Q2"
   - "Who are my top 5 vendors?"

## 🎊 Conclusion
